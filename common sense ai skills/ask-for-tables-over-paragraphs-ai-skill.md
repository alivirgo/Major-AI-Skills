# Ask for Tables Over Paragraphs (AI Skill)

## Overview
When asked to compare products, evaluate features, or summarize metrics, AI models naturally default to verbose, multi-paragraph essays filled with repetitive transitional phrases (*"On the other hand...", "Another notable point is..."*).

Requesting **structured Markdown tables** forces the model into high-density mode, saving up to 50% in token output, slashing reading time, and enabling direct copy-pasting into spreadsheets and documentation.

## The Efficiency & Density Comparison

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 Prose vs. Tabular Density                   │
│                                                             │
│  Narrative Prose:                                           │
│  • 400-600 tokens generated                                 │
│  • 90 seconds reading time                                  │
│  • High cognitive load to find specific attributes          │

│  Structured Markdown Table:                                 │
│  • 150-250 tokens generated (50%+ token savings)            │
│  • 15 seconds visual scan time                              │

## Schema-First Table Prompt Templates

### Pattern 1: The Explicit Column Schema Prompt
Specify the exact columns you need to prevent the AI from including irrelevant columns:

```markdown
Compare [ITEM A], [ITEM B], and [ITEM C] for [USE CASE].

Format your response EXCLUSIVELY as a single Markdown table with these columns:
- **Feature / Attribute**
- **[ITEM A]**
- **[ITEM B]**
- **[ITEM C]**
- **Ideal For (Target User)**

Constraints:
- Keep table cells concise (maximum 15 words per cell).
- Do not write introductory or concluding prose.
```

---

### Pattern 2: The Decision Scorecard Table
Use this for choosing between software, vendors, or candidates:

```markdown
Evaluate the top 3 options for [CATEGORY / TOOL].

Provide a Decision Matrix table with the following headers:
| Option Name | Primary Strength | Fatal Limitation | Pricing Tier | Quick Verdict (1-10) |
```

## Real-World Comparisons

### Scenario: Comparing Cloud Object Storage Providers

#### Verbose Paragraph Output (Low Density, High Token Waste)
> *"AWS S3 is one of the most established cloud storage services available. It offers standard storage starting around $0.023 per gigabyte per month. However, AWS charges egress fees when data leaves the region, which can add up quickly. Google Cloud Storage is quite similar in pricing, with standard storage starting at approximately $0.020 per GB, but integrates very closely with BigQuery and Google AI tools. Cloudflare R2, on the other hand, is a newer competitor that prices storage at $0.015 per GB and famously features zero egress fees..."*

#### Tabular Output (High Density, Instant Clarity)

```markdown
| Provider | Base Storage Cost | Egress (Bandwidth) Fees | Standout Strength | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AWS S3** | ~$0.023 / GB | $0.09 / GB | Deepest ecosystem & compliance certs | Enterprise AWS workloads |
| **Google Cloud Storage** | ~$0.020 / GB | $0.12 / GB | Native integration with BigQuery & Vertex AI | Data analytics & ML pipelines |
| **Cloudflare R2** | $0.015 / GB | **$0.00 (Zero Egress)** | Zero bandwidth fees & S3-compatible API | High-traffic media & web assets |
```

## Advanced Tabular Variations

| Need | Prompt Constraint |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Spreadsheet Import** | *"Output as a raw CSV code block so I can paste directly into Excel."* |
| **Sorted by Priority** | *"Sort table rows in descending order of cost impact."* |
| **Boolean Capability Check**| *"Use ✅ (Supported), ⚠️ (Partial), and ❌ (Unsupported) indicators."* |
| **Code / Syntax Reference** | *"Include an 'Example CLI Command' column with copy-pasteable syntax."* |

## Summary Best Practices
1. **Name the columns upfront**: Never say just *"put it in a table"*; specify the 4–6 exact columns you care about.
2. **Limit cell length**: Add *"Keep each cell under 10-15 words"* to prevent tables from wrapping awkwardly on smaller screens.
3. **Suppress intro/outro prose**: Add *"Output table only, no markdown chat filler"* for maximum token efficiency.
