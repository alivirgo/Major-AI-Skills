# Start a Fresh Chat for New Topics (Context Isolation) (AI Skill)

## Overview
Many users keep a single, perpetual AI conversation thread open for weeks, using it for everything from writing Python scripts to drafting marketing emails and planning vacations.

Long-running mega-threads suffer from **Context Pollution**: outdated instructions, past personas, and irrelevant variables linger in the model's active attention window, causing hallucinations, sluggish generation speeds, and massive $O(N^2)$ token billing.

The **Context Isolation Protocol** establishes strict thread lifecycle habits and introduces the **State Handoff Pattern** to carry forward only essential project state.

## Mega-Thread Pollution vs. Context Isolation

## The Thread Lifecycle Rules: When to Reset

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔄 KEEP THREAD OPEN IF:                                                   │
│ • Iterating on the same draft (e.g. "Now make section 2 shorter")         │
│ • Debugging the same code file through test runs                          │
│                                                                           │
│ 🛑 OPEN A NEW CHAT IMMEDIATELY IF:                                        │
│ • Switching to a different project or programming language               │
│ • The model starts repeating past errors or hallucinating old variables   │
│ • The thread exceeds 15-20 back-and-forth messages                       │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Master State Handoff Prompt Template

When transitioning a complex multi-turn project into a clean new chat, use the **State Handoff Pattern**:

### Step 1: Generate Handoff in the Old Chat
```markdown
We are finishing this phase of the project. 
Generate a concise "State Summary Handoff" in a single Markdown code block containing:
1. Current Project Architecture & Decisions Made
2. Verified Code / Deliverable Artifacts so far
3. Unfinished Next Steps & Current Blockers
```

### Step 2: Paste Handoff into the Fresh Chat
```markdown
I am continuing a project in this fresh thread. 
Here is our verified state handoff from our previous session:

<project_state>
[PASTE STATE SUMMARY]
</project_state>

Today's Task: Let's execute the first unfinished next step: [INSERT TASK].
```

## Real-World Case Study

### Scenario: Switching from Frontend CSS to Backend Database Queries

#### In a Polluted Mega-Thread
> **User**: *"Write an SQL query to calculate monthly active users."*
> ❌ *Model incorporates remnants from 20 messages ago: wrapping the SQL in React component hooks and Tailwind CSS classes because it is still anchored to the previous styling conversation.*

#### In a Fresh Isolated Thread
> **User**: *"Context: PostgreSQL 16 database with a `user_events` table. Write an optimized SQL query for Monthly Active Users (MAU)."*
> ✅ *Model returns clean, indexed SQL with window functions in 2 seconds.*

---

## Summary Best Practices
- **1 Project / 1 Feature = 1 Thread**: Treat AI threads like disposable scratchpads.
- **Reset when stuck in a loop**: If an AI fails to correct a code bug twice in a row, reset into a fresh thread and paste only the error and the clean function.
