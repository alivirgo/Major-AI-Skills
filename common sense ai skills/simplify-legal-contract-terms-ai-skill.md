# Simplify Legal Contract Terms (The Red-Flag Teardown) (AI Skill)

## Overview
Commercial vendor agreements, freelance contracts, and software terms of service are filled with dense, multi-page legalese designed to protect the drafter. Non-lawyers frequently skim and sign without realizing they agreed to automatic 1-year renewals, uncapped indemnities, or unilateral price increases.

The **Contract Red-Flag Teardown Protocol** scans agreements specifically for the **5 Highest-Risk Commercial Clauses**, translating them into plain English and highlighting hidden operational liabilities.

## Master Contract Teardown Prompt Templates

### Pattern 1: The Plain-English Red-Flag Scanner
Use before signing any vendor contract, freelance agreement, or SaaS subscription:

```markdown
Analyze the attached agreement: [ATTACH AGREEMENT / PASTE CLAUSES].

I am the [BUYER / FREELANCER / CUSTOMER].

Extract and translate the **Top 5 Commercial Risk Clauses** into a Markdown table:
| Clause Category | Exact Contract Text (Quote) | Plain-English Meaning | Risk Level (Low / Med / High) | Recommended Redline |

Specifically audit for:
1. **Auto-Renewal & Notice Windows**: What is the exact cancellation deadline before it auto-renews?
2. **Termination for Convenience**: Can I cancel early without paying out the remainder of the contract?
3. **Liability Caps**: Is liability capped at fees paid in the last 12 months, or is it uncapped?
4. **Data Ownership & Return**: What happens to my data if we part ways?
5. **Price Increase Clauses**: Does the vendor reserve the right to raise prices upon renewal?
```

### Pattern 2: The Clause Re-Writer (Fair & Mutual Redline)

```markdown
Here is a one-sided indemnity clause: [PASTE CLAUSE].

Rewrite this clause to make it **fair, standard, and mutual** for both parties. 
Include a 1-sentence defense I can send to the vendor's legal team explaining why this change is standard industry practice.
```

## Real-World Case Study

### Scenario: Auditing a SaaS Marketing Agency Agreement

#### The Buried Legalese (Section 9.4)
> *"This Agreement shall automatically renew for successive twelve (12) month terms unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal via certified mail at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term. In the event of early termination by Client, all unpaid fees for the remainder of the renewal term shall immediately accelerate and become due."*

#### AI Plain-English Teardown Output

> 🚨 **HIGH RISK CLAUSE DETECTED: Evergreen Auto-Renewal Trap**
> 
> - **What it means in Plain English**: If your contract ends on December 31st, you must send a certified physical letter before **October 2nd** (90 days prior). If you miss that window by 1 day, you are legally locked into paying for the entire next year ($36,000), even if you stop using their services.
> - **Recommended Redline**: Change *"90 days via certified mail"* to *"30 days via written email notice"*, and strike the *"fee acceleration"* clause.

## Summary Best Practices
- **Never sign without auditing the Auto-Renewal clause**: It is the #1 source of wasted corporate software spend.
- **Demand 30-day email notice**: Always replace certified mail requirements with standard email notice.
- **Check the Liability Cap**: Ensure total liability is capped at 12 months of fees paid.
