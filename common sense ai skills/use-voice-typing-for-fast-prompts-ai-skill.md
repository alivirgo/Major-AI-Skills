# Use Voice Typing for Rich Context (The 150-WPM Brain Dump) (AI Skill)

## Overview
The #1 cause of poor AI outputs is **Context Starvation**: users type a rushed, 1-sentence prompt (*"Write an email to my team about our roadmap changes"*) because typing on a keyboard is slow and friction-heavy ($~40\text{ words/minute}$).

Human speech flows at **150 to 180 words per minute**. 

The **Voice Dictation Protocol** leverages speech-to-text tools (Superwhisper, Mac Dictation, Whisper AI, or iOS Voice) to deliver a 60-second raw brain dump of rich nuances, edge cases, and emotional context without typing fatigue.

## Master Voice Cleanup Prompt Modifiers

Append this 1-liner to the start or end of any spoken brain dump:

```markdown
I just dictated the following stream of thought using voice typing. 
Filter out conversational filler ("ums", repetitions, self-corrections) and:

1. Extract the core decisions and tasks.
2. Draft the final [DELIVERABLE: e.g. Executive Slack Update / Client Memo].

Dictation:
"[SPOKEN TEXT FROM VOICE TYPING]"
```

## Real-World Case Study

### Scenario: Walking Out of a 1-on-1 Client Sync

#### User's 45-Second Voice Dictation (While Walking to Next Meeting)
> *"Okay AI, I just met with Sarah from Acme. She loves the design preview we sent yesterday, but she's super nervous about mobile load times because 80% of their shoppers are on phones. She also asked if we can push back the final sign-off from Friday to next Tuesday so their VP of Product can review it. Draft a warm follow-up email confirming the Tuesday extension and explaining that our WebP image compression pipeline will keep mobile load times under 1.2 seconds."*

#### AI-Generated Output (Generated in 3 Seconds)
> **Subject**: Acme Mobile Design Sync & Tuesday Timeline Confirmation
> 
> Hi Sarah,
> 
> Great catching up today! Thrilled to hear you loved the initial design direction.
> 
> To follow up on our discussion:
> 1. **Timeline Extended**: We've updated the final sign-off date to **next Tuesday, August 29th**, so your VP of Product can participate in the review.
> 2. **Mobile Speed Guarantee**: Mobile performance is our top priority. With our automated WebP compression and CDN edge caching, mobile load times will remain strictly under 1.2 seconds across all devices.
> 
> Looking forward to connecting next Tuesday!
> 
> Best,  
> [Your Name]

## Summary Best Practices
- **Never edit your speech while talking**: Speak in continuous stream-of-consciousness; the AI will parse your true intent flawlessly.
- **Use keyboard shortcuts**: Map a single key (e.g. `Fn Fn` or `Caps Lock`) to trigger local Whisper or OS dictation instantly.
