# Highlight Action Items at the Top (Top-Loaded Next Steps) (AI Skill)

## Overview
When an AI generates an analysis or meeting recap, it naturally places next steps at the very bottom (*"In conclusion, we should remember to..."*). When executives or team members skim the message on mobile, the actionable tasks are buried beneath paragraphs of context and easily missed.

The **Top-Loaded Action Item Protocol** inverts this structure: force the model to render a bold, prioritized **Action Item Callout Block** at the very top of the response, followed by the supporting analysis.

## Master Top-Loaded Action Prompt Templates

### Pattern 1: The Top-Loaded Executive Action Directive
Use for project recaps, strategy documents, or incident analyses:

```markdown
Analyze the attached project notes / incident log: [INSERT TEXT].

Response Structure Requirements:
1. **SECTION 1: IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (Top-Loaded)**:
   Place at the very beginning inside a Markdown callout or bold numbered list:
   - Format: `[ ] [OWNER] - [EXACT TASK] (Deadline: [TIME / DATE])`
2. **SECTION 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Max 3 bullets)**
3. **SECTION 3: SUPPORTING ANALYSIS & CONTEXT**

Do NOT bury action items at the end of the response.
```

---

### Pattern 2: The Fast Slack Sync Format

```markdown
Turn these notes into a team update ready for Slack:
- Begin with a 3-item "🚨 REQUIRED ACTIONS BY TODAY" section tagging `@Owner`.
- Follow with a short 2-bullet background context.
```

## Real-World Case Study

### Scenario: Post-Incident Outage Summary

#### Default AI Output (Actions Buried at End)
> *"At 14:22 UTC, our primary database CPU spiked to 100% due to an un-indexed query on the orders table. The on-call engineer restarted the replica, which mitigated the issue by 14:45 UTC. We lost approximately $4,200 in cart checkouts during the window. Moving forward, the backend team should remember to add indexes to the foreign keys, and DevOps should configure Prometheus alert thresholds before Friday..."*
> 
> ❌ *(The critical task of adding indexes and setting up alerts is buried in a wall of text).*

#### Top-Loaded Action Protocol Output

> ### ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (Priority Post-Mortem Tasks)
> - [ ] **[BACKEND - DAVE]** Add composite index on `orders(customer_id, created_at)` and deploy to production *(Deadline: Today, 5:00 PM UTC)*.
> - [ ] **[DEVOPS - LISA]** Lower Prometheus database CPU alert threshold from 95% to 80% *(Deadline: Tomorrow, 12:00 PM UTC)*.
> - [ ] **[FINANCE - MARK]** Issue credit vouchers for the 14 affected customer checkout carts *(Deadline: Thursday, 5:00 PM UTC)*.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 📊 Incident Breakdown & Root Cause
> - **Outage Duration**: 23 minutes (14:22 - 14:45 UTC).
> - **Financial Impact**: ~$4,200 in delayed checkouts (all orders recoverable).
> - **Root Cause**: Table scan on 12M rows triggered by a missing index on the checkout webhook query.
