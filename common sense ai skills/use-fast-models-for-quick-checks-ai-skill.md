# Use Fast Models for Quick Checks (Model Routing Economics) (AI Skill)

## Overview
Using a heavyweight reasoning model (like OpenAI o1 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to fix a spelling mistake, extract a date, or format a Markdown table is like hiring a senior structural engineer to screw in a lightbulb.

Heavy models are **10x to 50x more expensive** and have significantly higher latency (5–15 seconds vs. 400ms).

The **Model Routing Economics Protocol** matches task cognitive difficulty to the optimal model tier, slashing AI API costs and accelerating daily workflow velocity.

## Task-to-Model Decision Guide

| Daily Task | Recommended Tier | Example Model | Why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fix Grammar & Typos** | Tier 1 (Lightweight) | Claude Haiku / 4o-mini | Perfect accuracy, 200ms latency, zero waste. |
| **Convert Unstructured Text to TSV**| Tier 1 (Lightweight) | Gemini Flash / 4o-mini | Deterministic parsing, 90% cheaper than Sonnet. |
| **Write a Full React Component** | Tier 2 (Frontier) | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Requires nuanced architectural & styling awareness. |
| **Debug Race Condition / Deadlock**| Tier 3 (Reasoning) | OpenAI o1 / o3-mini | Requires multi-step chain-of-thought search. |

## Real-World Cost Analysis

### Scenario: Processing 10,000 Customer Support Tickets per Month

- **Using Tier 2 (Claude 3.5 Sonnet / GPT-4o)**:  
  $10,000 \text{ tickets} \times 1,500 \text{ tokens} = 15\text{M tokens} \rightarrow \mathbf{\$45.00 - \$75.00}$
- **Using Tier 1 (Claude 3.5 Haiku / GPT-4o-mini)**:  
  $10,000 \text{ tickets} \times 1,500 \text{ tokens} = 15\text{M tokens} \rightarrow \mathbf{\$2.25 - \$4.50}$

**Result**: **94% Cost Reduction** with 4x faster response times and zero measurable degradation in classification accuracy.

## Summary Best Practices
- **Default to the fast model first**: In web chat interfaces, keep your default set to the fast/mini model for everyday queries; switch to the heavy model only when writing code or complex strategy.
- **Use Two-Stage Cascades**: In API pipelines, use a fast model to classify and filter incoming data, only routing the complex 5% of edge cases to the heavy frontier model.
