# Skip Polite Filler Words (Zero-Fluff Prompting) (AI Skill)

## Overview
Many users interact with AI assistants using human conversational pleasantries (*"Hello! I hope you are having a wonderful day. Could you please kindly be so good as to help me..."*). 

While well-intentioned, language models do not have feelings, egos, or social obligations. Conversational filler wastes input tokens, slows typing speed, and subtly biases the model's response towards overly polite, apologetic, and verbose text.

The **Zero-Fluff Prompting Protocol** cuts out all social packaging, focusing 100% of prompt tokens on task definition, context, and constraints.

## Token & Time Waste Analysis

Across a team of 10 professionals sending 30 prompts per day:
- **Average Pleasantry Waste**: ~15 tokens per prompt + 5 seconds typing time.
- **Monthly Waste**: $10 \text{ people} \times 30 \text{ prompts} \times 22 \text{ days} \times 15 \text{ tokens} = \mathbf{99,000\text{ wasted tokens/month}}$.
- **Monthly Time Lost**: Over **9 hours of wasted typing** on pleasantries that the neural network ignores.

## The Lean Prompting Translation Guide

| Conversational / Polite Input | Lean Imperative Prompt |
| :--- | :--- |
| *"Hi there, could you please write a regex for emails?"* | *"Write a Python regex to validate email addresses."* |
| *"I would really appreciate it if you could summarize this."* | *"Summarize this document in 3 bullet points."* |
| *"Thank you so much, that was great! Now can you..."* | *"Now refactor function `process_payment()` for async."* |
| *"Sorry to ask, but is there any way to make this faster?"* | *"Optimize this SQL query to eliminate the table scan."* |

## Real-World Comparison

### Scenario: Asking for an API Endpoint Definition

#### Fluffy Conversational Prompt (38 Tokens)
> *"Hello Claude! Hope you are doing well today. I am currently working on our backend and was wondering if you could please help me create an Express.js route for user login? Thanks so much!"*

#### Lean Imperative Prompt (12 Tokens)
> *"Create an Express.js POST `/auth/login` route with JWT signing and bcrypt password verification."*

**Outcome**: The lean prompt produces the code 3 seconds faster, eliminates the *"Hello! I'd be happy to help you with that Express route!"* preamble, and gets straight to work.

## Summary Best Practices
- **Lead with the action verb**: Start with *Draft, Refactor, Calculate, Compare, Audit*.
- **Save your manners for humans**: Machines perform best on unambiguous, high-density instructions.
