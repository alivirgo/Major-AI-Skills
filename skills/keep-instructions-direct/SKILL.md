# Keep Instructions Direct (The Imperative Lead Protocol) (AI Skill)

## Overview
Starting a prompt with polite conversational preambles (*"Hey there! I was wondering if you might have time to possibly help me review..."*) burns initial prompt token weights on meaningless social pleasantries. 

Because Large Language Models attend most heavily to the first tokens of a message, leading with an **Imperative Action Verb** immediately focuses the model's neural attention on the exact cognitive operation required.

## The Power Verb Taxonomy

Replace weak, passive verbs with high-leverage imperative commands:

| Weak / Vague Verb | High-Precision Imperative Verb | Exact Action Triggered in LLM |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *"Look at this"* | **AUDIT** | Evaluates systematically against criteria/rules. |
| *"Make it better"* | **REFACTOR** | Restructures architecture/code without breaking logic. |
| *"Explain this"* | **SYNTHESIZE** | Condenses key points into high-density takeaways. |
| *"Give me ideas"* | **BRAINSTORM [X] ANGLES** | Generates high-contrast divergent options. |
| *"Fix mistakes"* | **REDLINE** | Shows exact deletions and insertions. |
| *"Put together"* | **SCAFFOLD** | Creates structural skeletons and starter templates. |

## Real-World Transformations

### Example 1: Code Review
- ❌ **Passive**: *"Can you check this python code and tell me what you think?"*
- ✅ **Imperative**: *"**AUDIT** this Python function for thread safety and memory leaks. Provide the refactored code."*

### Example 2: Market Analysis
- ❌ **Passive**: *"I need some information on the EV market."*
- ✅ **Imperative**: *"**SYNTHESIZE** the top 3 supply chain bottlenecks in the US EV battery market into a 3-column table."*

### Example 3: Copy Editing
- ❌ **Passive**: *"Help me rewrite this email so it sounds nicer."*
- ✅ **Imperative**: *"**REWRITE** this email to sound warm and collaborative. Keep it under 75 words."*

## The 3-Word Prompt Opener Formula
Structure the first 3 words of every prompt as:
> **`[IMPERATIVE VERB] + [EXACT TARGET] + [PRIMARY CONSTRAINT]`**
> 
> *Example*: `"**DRAFT** [a 2-paragraph memo] [for executive leadership]..."`
> *Example*: `"**EXTRACT** [all dollar amounts] [into a TSV code block]..."`
