# Break Complex Projects into Milestones (Work Breakdown Structure) (AI Skill)

## Overview
Vague project plans (*"Launch the new website by Q3"*) fail because they lack intermediate dependency mapping and concrete checkpoints. When you prompt an AI to plan a project without structure, it returns high-level motivational checklists rather than an operational project roadmap.

The **Milestone Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Protocol** prompts the AI to act as a seasoned Technical Project Manager, constructing critical-path timelines, identifying blocker dependencies, and establishing strict **Definition of Done (DoD)** criteria for every phase.

## Master WBS Prompt Templates

### Pattern 1: The 4-Week Agile Sprint Roadmap
Use for technical launches, product releases, or marketing overhauls:

```markdown
Act as a Senior Technical Project Manager.
Create a structured 4-Week Milestone Roadmap to [INSERT PROJECT GOAL] within a deadline of [TIMEFRAME / WEEKS].

For EACH week, provide:
1. **Weekly Theme & Primary Objective**: The single focus of that sprint.
2. **Key Deliverables**: 2-3 concrete artifacts (code, documents, assets) produced.
3. **Critical Dependencies & Blockers**: What must be completed before this week can start?
4. **Definition of Done (DoD)**: The exact verification test required to pass.

Format as clean, nested Markdown tables.
```

---

### Pattern 2: The Linear / Jira Task Ticket Generator
Converts a milestone directly into actionable task cards:

```markdown
Based on Milestone [NAME / WEEK], generate 5 discrete Jira/Linear task tickets.

For each ticket, format as:
- **Title**: [Action Verb + Component + Outcome]
- **Estimated Effort**: [Story Points or Hours]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 2-3 testable bullet points
- **Assigned Role**: [Backend / Frontend / Design / QA]
```

## Real-World Case Study

### Scenario: Launching a Mobile App MVP

#### Vague Prompt Output
> ❌ *"Week 1: Design app. Week 2: Build app. Week 3: Test app. Week 4: Launch to App Store."* *(Zero operational utility).*

#### Structured WBS Prompt Output

```markdown
### Week 1: Core Architecture & Authentication Engine
- **Objective**: Establish stable multi-platform build and secure auth pipeline.
- **Deliverables**:
  - React Native / Expo base repository configured with TypeScript and ESLint.
  - Supabase / Firebase Auth integration (Apple Sign-In & Google Auth).
- **Critical Blocker**: Apple Developer Enterprise Account approval.
- **Definition of Done**: A tester can sign in via Apple on a physical iOS device and view a blank authenticated dashboard.

### Week 2: Core Feature Loop & Local Persistence
- **Objective**: Build the primary user workflow end-to-end.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Main user dashboard with CRUD functionality.
  - Offline-first SQLite local caching for instant load times.
- **Critical Blocker**: Finalized database schema from Week 1.
- **Definition of Done**: User can create, edit, and delete an item offline, and sync seamlessly when Wi-Fi reconnects.

### Week 3: Stress Testing, Error Tracking & Beta Distribution
- **Objective**: Hardening the build against crashes and boundary conditions.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Sentry error logging and PostHog analytics instrumentation.
  - TestFlight beta build distributed to 20 external testers.
- **Critical Blocker**: Zero P0/P1 crashes reported across 50 test sessions.
- **Definition of Done**: 20 beta testers complete onboarding without a single fatal exception.

### Week 4: App Store Submission & Production Cutover
- **Objective**: Store approval, privacy compliance, and public launch.
- **Deliverables**:
  - App Store screenshots, privacy nutrition labels, and marketing landing page.
  - Production CDN DNS cutover.
- **Definition of Done**: App is officially approved and live on the Apple App Store.

## Milestone Health Checklist

| Metric | Target Standard |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Duration per Milestone** | 3 to 7 working days max |
| **Deliverable Clarity** | Tangible artifact (not "research" or "planning") |
| **Verification Gate** | Binary pass/fail test (no subjective estimates) |
| **Dependency Awareness** | Explicitly declared before sprint start |
