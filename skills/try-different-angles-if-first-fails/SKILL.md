# Try Different Angles (The Prompt Pivot Protocol) (AI Skill)

## Overview
When an AI gives a poor or stubborn response, many users make the mistake of re-typing the exact same prompt with minor word tweaks (*"No, that's not what I meant. Please explain it again"*). 

Because the conversation thread is anchored to the previous context, repeating the same question keeps the model trapped in the same semantic loop.

The **Prompt Pivot Protocol** breaks conversational deadlocks by changing the **perspective, vector, or framing** of the problem across 4 distinct pivot strategies.

## The 4 Pivot Strategies in Detail

### 1. The Inversion Pivot (Charlie Munger Model)
If the AI is struggling to give you good advice on how to succeed, ask it **how to guarantee catastrophic failure**:
- *Stubborn Query*: *"How do I make my marketing campaign viral?"* (Produces generic tips).
- *Inversion Pivot*: *"What are the top 3 ways a marketing campaign in this niche instantly flops and wastes budget?"* (Produces sharp, actionable failure modes to avoid).

---

### 2. The Persona Pivot
Shift the role from general assistant to a specific, opinionated practitioner:
- *Stubborn Query*: *"How do I structure my startup's cap table?"*
- *Persona Pivot*: *"Act as an aggressive late-stage VC conducting Series B due diligence. What cap table red flags would make you reject this company?"*

---

### 3. The Decomposition Pivot
Break a complex monolith question into sequential components:
- *Stubborn Query*: *"Write a complete real-time chat app with WebSockets, auth, and database persistence."*
- *Decomposition Pivot*: *"Let's build this in 3 steps. Step 1: Write ONLY the WebSocket server connection handler in Node.js. Nothing else."*

---

### 4. The Exemplar Pivot (Few-Shot Injection)
Provide one concrete input/output pair to anchor the desired structure:
- *Stubborn Query*: *"Format these names and emails."* (Output format is messy).
- *Exemplar Pivot*: *"Follow this exact pattern: `John Doe <john@acme.com> | Active`"*

## Real-World Case Study

### Scenario: Debugging an Elusive React Re-Render Performance Issue

#### The Stubborn Loop (Re-asking the same question)
> **User**: *"Why is my React component re-rendering slowly?"*
> **AI**: *"React components re-render when state changes. Make sure you use `useMemo` and `useCallback`."*
> **User**: *"I tried that, it's still slow."*
> ❌ *(AI repeats generic memoization advice).*

#### The Inversion & Exemplar Pivot (Instant Breakthrough)
> **User Pivot**: *"Here is the component code: [PASTE CODE]. 
> Let's invert the problem: Identify the top 2 places in this component where a **new object or array reference is being created inside the render cycle on every tick**."*

**AI Response**:
> **Pinpointed Bug**: Lines 14 and 28 pass an inline object literal `style={{ margin: 10 }}` and an inline filter `items.filter(...)` directly into child props, invalidating React's shallow prop comparison on every render! Move the filter outside the JSX.

## Summary Best Practices
- **Never repeat the same prompt twice**: If Turn 1 fails, pivot the vector.
- **Invert the problem**: Asking how to break something often yields 10x deeper insights than asking how to build it.
