# Beware of Hallucinated Quotes & Citations (AI Skill)

## Overview
One of the most insidious failure modes of Large Language Models is the generation of **plausible but completely fabricated quotations**. Models will effortlessly attribute memorable, eloquent aphorisms to historical figures (Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill, Mark Twain, Steve Jobs) or invent non-existent book titles, chapters, and academic paper DOIs.

This skill details the **Attribution & Quotation Grounding Protocol**: rules and prompts to force verbatim fidelity and prevent embarrassing attribution errors.

## The Attribution Grounding Protocol

Before including an AI-generated quotation in a speech, presentation, manuscript, or legal filing, apply these 3 rules:

1. **The Exact-Quote Search**: Copy the exact quoted sentence in quotation marks (`"..."`) and search Google Books or Google Scholar. If zero exact matches exist, it is a synthetic fabrication.
2. **Demand Chapter & Primary Source**: Require the AI to name the exact book title, publication year, chapter, or primary speech context.
3. **Paraphrase If Unverified**: If you cannot verify the exact primary text, rephrase as a conceptual principle rather than a direct quote.

## Master Grounding Prompt Templates

### Pattern 1: The Verbatim-Only Citation Directive
Use this for essays, research, or executive speeches:

```markdown
Provide a quotation regarding [TOPIC / THEME].

Strict Verification Rules:
1. Provide ONLY verified, word-for-word verbatim quotations from recorded primary sources.
2. Underneath the quote, state:
  - Speaker / Author
  - Primary Source (Book Title, Speech, or Essay)
  - Year of Publication or Delivery
3. If no verified quote from a primary source exists on this topic, state: "NO DIRECT HISTORICAL QUOTE FOUND" and provide a modern paraphrased summary instead. Do NOT invent a quotation.
```

---

### Pattern 2: Academic & Legal Citation Guardrail
Use when requesting research literature:

```markdown
Identify 3 seminal papers on [RESEARCH TOPIC].

Rules:
- For every paper, provide the Author(s), Year, Title, Journal/Conference, and verified DOI or PubMed/ArXiv ID.
- If you are not 100% certain of the exact title and DOI, write: "[UNCERTAIN CITATION - REQUIRES MANUAL CHECK]".
```

## Real-World Case Study

### Scenario: Keynote Presentation on Innovation

#### Hallucinated Quote (High Reputational Risk)
> **AI Draft**: *"As Albert Einstein once famously remarked: 'Innovation is the courage to discard yesterday's proven certainties for tomorrow's untested possibilities.' (The World As I See It, 1949)"*
>
> ❌ *Reality: Einstein never said or wrote this. The AI synthesized a plausible-sounding management cliché and attached a real Einstein book title to make it look authentic.*

#### Verified Quote Grounding Prompt & Result
> **User**: *"Provide a verified, verbatim quotation by a prominent scientist on scientific courage, with exact source citation."*

**AI Response**:
> **Quote**: *"It is the customary fate of new truths to begin as heresies and to end as superstitions."*
>
> **Speaker**: Thomas Henry Huxley
> **Source**: *Science and Culture, and Other Essays* (1881), Chapter: "The Coming of Age of 'The Origin of Species'", p. 317.
> **Verification**: Verifiable in public domain archives of Huxley's collected essays.

## Quick Verification Checklist

| Element | High Risk (Do Not Trust AI) | Safe Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Famous Person Quotes** | Einstein, Churchill, Lincoln, Jobs, Sun Tzu | Search string on [Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org) |
| **Legal Precedents** | Case names (e.g., *Smith v. TechCorp*) | Verify on Google Scholar / LexisNexis |
| **Academic Papers** | Fabricated DOIs and co-authors | Check DOI resolver (`doi.org/<DOI>`) |
| **Book Chapters** | "Chapter 4 of Thinking Fast and Slow" | Check Google Books table of contents |
