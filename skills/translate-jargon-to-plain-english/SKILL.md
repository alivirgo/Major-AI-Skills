# Translate Jargon to Plain English (The 3-Tier Decoder) (AI Skill)

## Overview
Specialized industries (law, medicine, enterprise cloud, finance) use dense, exclusionary terminology that conceals simple concepts behind Latin roots and acronyms (*e.g., "idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura"*, *"joint and several indemnification"*, *"idempotent egress throttling"*).

The **3-Tier Jargon Decoder Protocol** demystifies dense text by breaking it down into: the **Plain English Definition**, a **Real-World Analogy**, and the **"So What?" Practical Impact**.

## Real-World Case Study

### Scenario: Translating an Insurance Policy Exclusivity Clause

#### Raw Insurance Jargon
> *"The Insurer shall be subrogated to all the Insured's rights of recovery against any person or organization to the extent of any payment made hereunder, and the Insured shall execute and deliver instruments and papers and do whatever else is necessary to secure such rights and shall do nothing after loss to prejudice such rights."*

#### AI Jargon Decoder Output

| Original Jargon | Plain-English Translation | The "So What?" Practical Impact on You |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Subrogated to rights of recovery"** | If the insurance company pays you for your damaged car, they get the legal right to sue the driver who hit you to get their money back. | **Do not sign any private settlement or waiver** with the other driver after an accident. If you sign away their liability, your insurer can legally refuse to pay your claim! |

## Summary Best Practices
- **Always ask for the "So What?"**: The literal definition isn't enough; you need to know how the term affects your money, health, or workload.
- **Enforce an 8th-grade reading level**: Keeps the output crisp and conversational.
