# Draft Multiple Angle Variations (Psychological Angle Diversity) (AI Skill)

## Overview
When you ask an AI for *"5 variations of this headline,"* it almost always returns minor synonym swaps (*"Boost your speed"*, *"Increase your speed"*, *"Improve your velocity"*). These are functionally identical and provide zero creative leverage.

The **Psychological Angle Diversity Framework** forces the AI to construct variations across **5 distinct psychological archetypes** (Curiosity, Direct Benefit, Urgency / Loss Aversion, Social Proof, and the Counter-Intuitive Hook).

## Master Angle Variation Prompt Templates

### Pattern 1: The 5-Angle Headline / Subject Line Generator
Use for emails, articles, landing pages, or YouTube titles:

```markdown
I need 5 distinct headline / subject line options for [PRODUCT / ARTICLE / NEWSLETTER].
Topic & Core Value: [INSERT TOPIC]

Generate exactly 1 option for each of these 5 psychological angles:
1. **Direct Benefit**: Focus on the specific outcome, metric, or time saved.
2. **Curiosity Gap**: Provoke an irresistible question without being cheap clickbait.
3. **Loss Aversion / Urgency**: Highlight what the reader loses by ignoring this.
4. **Social Proof / Authority**: Leverage numbers, industry standards, or peer consensus.
5. **Counter-Intuitive / Paradigm Shift**: Challenge a common assumption or rule.

Keep each option under 9 words. Output as a clean Markdown table with the Angle Name.
```

### Pattern 2: The Multi-Audience Value Prop Variations
Use for positioning the same product to different decision-makers:

```markdown
Here is our core product feature: [INSERT FEATURE].

Draft 3 distinct 1-sentence value propositions tailored to:
- **Angle 1 (The CFO)**: Financial ROI and cost reduction.
- **Angle 2 (The Engineer)**: Developer ergonomics and reliability.
- **Angle 3 (The End-User)**: Day-to-day speed and ease of use.

## Real-World Case Study

### Scenario: Newsletter on Developer Productivity & Async Work

#### Low-Diversity AI Output (Weak Synonym Swaps)
> 1. How to be more productive with async work
> 2. Improving productivity through async communication
> 3. Boost your team's async productivity
> 4. The productive guide to working asynchronously
> 5. Better productivity with asynchronous workflows
> 
> ❌ *(Zero creative diversity, identical tone).*

#### High-Contrast Angle Output (High Diversity)

| Angle Archetype | Subject Line Variation | Psychological Trigger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Direct Benefit** | *"How our engineers got 10 hours of focus back this week"* | Specific, quantifiable time-saving reward. |
| **2. Curiosity Gap** | *"The one meeting we killed that doubled our shipping speed"* | Unresolved narrative hook. |
| **3. Loss Aversion** | *"Your 9 AM standup is costing you $180k a year"* | Fear of waste and hidden financial drain. |
| **4. Social Proof** | *"Why 500+ top engineering teams abandoned daily standups"* | Conformity and industry validation. |
| **5. Counter-Intuitive** | *"Why working longer hours actually slows down your roadmap"* | Challenges conventional hustle wisdom. |

## Summary Best Practices
- **Never ask for "just 5 more options"**: Always specify the *mechanism* or *angle* behind each option.
- **Test the top 2 in production**: Run A/B subject line tests between your chosen *Direct Benefit* and *Curiosity Gap* options.
