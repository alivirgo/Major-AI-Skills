# Ask for the One Best Answer (The 80/20 Leverage Rule) (AI Skill)

## Overview
When users ask an AI for *"10 ideas to grow revenue"* or *"5 ways to fix this performance bug,"* the model spreads its token budget and attention across multiple mediocre, generic suggestions. 

By commanding the AI to give **the single highest-conviction, highest-leverage recommendation**, you force the model to rank options internally and output a deeply fleshed-out, immediately executable plan.

## Master "One Best Answer" Prompt Templates

### Pattern 1: The High-Conviction Executive Directive
Use this for business decisions, marketing, and strategic growth:

```markdown
I want to achieve [SPECIFIC GOAL] within [TIMEFRAME] with [RESOURCES / BUDGET].

Do NOT give me a list of 10 generic options.
Instead:
1. Identify the **single highest-leverage strategy** that will drive 80% of the results.
2. Defend why this specific strategy beats other alternatives.
3. Provide a step-by-step tactical execution plan for week 1.
4. Highlight the #1 fatal pitfall to avoid.
```

---

### Pattern 2: The Single Root-Cause Fix (Engineering & Debugging)
Use this when troubleshooting complex production issues:

```markdown
Here is the error log and stack trace: [PASTE ERROR].

Do not guess 5 possible reasons. 
Give me the single most statistically probable root cause, the exact line to fix, and the corrected code.
```

## Real-World Case Study

### Scenario: Improving SaaS Onboarding Activation

#### The Diluted 10-Item List Prompt
> **User**: *"Give me 10 ideas to improve onboarding conversion for our CRM app."*
>
> ❌ *AI Output*:
> 1. Add a product tour.
> 2. Send welcome emails.
> 3. Add video tooltips.
> 4. Simplify the signup form.
> 5. Offer live chat support... *(8 more shallow ideas that leave the user wondering which one actually moves the needle)*.

#### The High-Conviction "One Best" Prompt & Result
> **User**: *"What is the single most critical onboarding change that drives retention in B2B SaaS?"*

**AI Response**:
> **The #1 Lever: The "Empty-State Quick-Start Template" (Fast Time-to-Value)**
>
> **The Defense**: 70% of churn during SaaS onboarding occurs because users face a blank screen and don't know what data to enter. Providing a pre-populated workspace with 1-click sample data reduces Time-to-Value (TTV) from 18 minutes to under 45 seconds.
>
> **Execution Blueprint**:
> 1. **Immediate Action**: Add a modal on first login: *"Load demo data with 5 sample deals (Recommended)"* vs *"Start with blank workspace"*.
> 2. **Metric to Track**: Percentage of new signups who interact with a sample deal within 2 minutes of signup.
> 3. **The Fatal Trap to Avoid**: Do not force users through a multi-step unskippable carousel tour.
