# Keep Sensitive Financials Private (Data Anonymization) (AI Skill)

## Overview
Pasting confidential company profit & loss (P&L) statements, employee salary sheets, bank account numbers, or secret cap tables into public AI models poses serious corporate security, compliance (GDPR/SOC2), and competitive risks.

The **Data Anonymization & Synthetic Scaling Protocol** enables you to leverage AI's advanced mathematical and financial reasoning capabilities while keeping 100% of your real confidential financial numbers and customer identities secret.

## The 3 Rules of Safe Financial Prompting

### 1. The Proportional Scaling Trick
Multiply or divide all your raw numbers by a fixed constant (e.g. $1.5\times$ or $10\times$). 
Because financial metrics (Gross Margin %, Runway in Months, CAC-to-LTV ratio, Year-over-Year Growth %) are proportional, the AI's financial analysis will be **100% mathematically valid**, while your real confidential balance remains completely hidden.

### 2. Entity Aliasing (Search & Replace)
Never include real company names or individual personnel:
- Replace *"JPMorgan Chase"* with *"Tier-1 Enterprise Bank"*.
- Replace *"Sarah Connor ($180k/yr)"* with *"Lead Engineer A ($X/yr)"*.

### 3. Strip Account Identifiers
Always purge credit card numbers, routing numbers, Tax IDs (EIN/SSN), and wire transfer codes.

## Master Anonymized Financial Prompt Templates

### Pattern 1: The Scaled Runway & Unit Economics Analysis

```markdown
Analyze the unit economics of this SaaS company based on anonymized, normalized metrics:

Financial Snapshot (Indexed/Normalized Units):
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR): 100 units
- Cost of Goods Sold (Hosting + Support): 22 units
- Sales & Marketing Spend: 35 units
- R&D / Engineering Payroll: 40 units
- General & Administrative: 15 units
- Net Monthly Burn: 12 units
- Cash in Bank: 180 units

Task:
1. Calculate the Gross Margin percentage.
2. Calculate the exact cash runway in months.
3. Provide 3 specific recommendations to reach break-even cash flow.

## Real-World Comparison

### Scenario: Reviewing an Acquisition Term Sheet

#### Risky Prompt (Confidential Leak)
> ❌ *"Here is the confidential term sheet from Microsoft offering $18.5M for my startup WidgetCo with a 4-year earnout for founders Alice and Bob..."*
> *(Violates NDA and exposes deal valuation to third-party model training).*

#### Anonymized Safe Prompt
> ✅ *"Review this anonymized acquisition term sheet for a B2B SaaS company:
> - Offer: $X Cash at closing + 25% Earnout tied to Year 2 revenue targets.
> - Founder Retention: 3-year non-compete and 2-year vesting clawback.
> 
> What are the 3 biggest contractual and tax traps founders face in this structure?"*

## Privacy Checklist Before Hitting Send
- [ ] Are all company, customer, and employee names converted to aliases?
- [ ] Are absolute dollar amounts scaled or converted to percentages/ratios?
- [ ] Have all bank account numbers, tax IDs, and addresses been deleted?
- [ ] Does this prompt comply with your organization's corporate data security policy?
